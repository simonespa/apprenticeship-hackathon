    "# Hackathon\n",
    "\n",
    "The L7 AI Hackathon will give you an opportunity to work in a team of four/five to test your new data science and ML skills. You will be required to deliver a 15mins presentation (10mins presentation and 5mins for Q&A) about your learning journey in the programme & the outcome of your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are going to be provided with a sample of possible questions to investigate and tasks to undertake. However, you are free to design your own tasks as a team and augment the initial datasets for your own analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hackathon, we want you to build machine learning models to predict COVID-19 infections from symptoms. It has several applications â€“ for example, triaging patients to be attended by a doctor or nurse, recommending self-isolation through contact tracing apps, etc.\n",

    "Zoabi et al. ([link here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-00372-6)) [1] builds a decision tree classifier using the publicly available data reported by the Israeli Ministry of Health. The paper itself discusses the various challenges encountered in deploying such a model. We encourage you to read the paper and learn the challenges and ways to overcome them. We will be using the dataset in this paper (Github link in the references)."
